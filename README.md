# A color detection tool build with Python
## This code uses open-cv for getting the RGB values of a point and the calculate minimum distance from all colours and get most matching colour

### Libraries Required:
  1) Open-CV (pip install opencv-python)
  2) Pandas (pip install pandas)
  3) Numpy (pip install numpy)

### Step 1:
Install all the above mentioned libraries.

### Step 2:
In this project, you need to specify the path of image you are using to the variable img_path and also set the path of the .csv file which contains RGB values of all the colors in color_detection.py file.

### Step 3:
Run color_detection.py file.

## On a perfect execution of this file, you should have similar outputs as you can see in Outputs folder.
